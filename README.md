# bot_detector
This is my personal project for a bot detector on Twitter.

Initial data used for training comes from datasets available at https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/bot-repository/datasets.html

`tidy_data.py` will transform the datasets as available from the repository to a usable file.
`read_from_twitter.py` builds the data from Twitter.
